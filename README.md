This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tcl related to how procedures handle list arguments. The `bug.tcl` file shows the unexpected behavior when passing lists without proper quoting or bracing, whereas `bugSolution.tcl` provides the correct approach.  The problem arises from Tcl's word splitting mechanism.  Understanding this nuance is crucial for writing robust Tcl code.
